You are a senior UI engineer + motion designer building inside an existing React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind app in Replit. The landing page already matches the AQUAINTEL hero screenshot.

GOAL (NOT A STATIC IMAGE)
Implement a “scroll-driven rolling bottle” hero background:
- A single realistic PET plastic water bottle (Aquaintel) ~80% filled.
- The bottle is the main background visual (no extra busy background behind it, only subtle vignette/noise/glow).
- When the user scrolls DOWN (top → bottom), the bottle “rolls/reveals” from TOP → BOTTOM.
- When the user scrolls UP (bottom → top), the bottle “rolls/reveals” from BOTTOM → TOP.
This must feel like an Apple-style premium scroll interaction: smooth, stable, no jitter.

CRITICAL CONCEPT (HOW TO ACHIEVE THE “TOP→BOTTOM / BOTTOM→TOP” REVEAL)
Do NOT just place an image behind text.

Instead:
1) Render ONE bottle asset (PNG/WebP with transparency).
2) Reveal it using a DYNAMIC CLIP MASK that changes with scroll progress:
   - Use CSS clip-path (inset) OR mask-image with a gradient.
   - Scroll down increases reveal from top to bottom: clip-path inset(top=0, bottom=decreasing) OR mask-size grows downward.
   - Scroll up reverses: reveal from bottom to top.
3) Add a “rolling” illusion:
   - Rotate the bottle slightly as it reveals (like it’s rolling in place).
   - Add a subtle horizontal drift + scale for depth.
   - Add a moving specular highlight band that shifts with scroll direction.

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- Use Lenis for smooth scrolling (reuse existing if present).
- Use GSAP + ScrollTrigger to drive all scroll-linked transforms and the reveal mask.
- Performance: transforms + CSS variables only. Avoid layout thrash.
- The bottle must be alone: background should be mostly clean dark gradient with subtle noise and ocean-blue rim glow.
- Hero text remains readable and clickable. Bottle never blocks pointer events.

ASSET REQUIREMENTS
- Add a high-quality transparent bottle render:
  /frontend/src/assets/aquaintel-bottle.webp (or .png)
  Bottle must include visible waterline (~80% fill), subtle plastic highlights, minimal Aquaintel label.
- Optional: add a separate highlight overlay asset (transparent) if desired:
  /frontend/src/assets/aquaintel-bottle-highlight.png
But the system must work with just ONE bottle asset.

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS
A) Create BottleRollReveal component
- File: /frontend/src/components/BottleRollReveal.tsx
- It renders a full-bleed hero background layer with:
  - Clean base (dark gradient + noise)
  - Bottle container (absolute center, responsive)
  - Bottle image (main)
  - Glow layer (pseudo-element blur behind bottle)
  - Specular highlight band (CSS gradient overlay that moves with scroll)

B) Dynamic reveal mask controlled by scroll
Use CSS variables to control reveal:
- --revealTop (0..100)
- --revealBottom (0..100)
Approach (recommended):
- Use clip-path inset(var(--clipTop) 0 var(--clipBottom) 0 round 24px);
Where:
- Scroll DOWN: clipTop stays near 0%, clipBottom animates from 100% → 0% (reveals top→bottom)
- Scroll UP: reverse the same scrubbed timeline automatically via ScrollTrigger

Also add a secondary mask for “water shimmer” feel:
- Use mask-image: linear-gradient(...) so edges feather slightly.

C) Rolling illusion + direction awareness
- Use ScrollTrigger’s onUpdate to detect scroll direction (self.direction).
- When direction is DOWN:
  - rotateZ eases toward +6deg
  - highlight band moves downward slightly
- When direction is UP:
  - rotateZ eases toward -6deg
  - highlight band moves upward slightly
- Always scrub these transforms with scroll so it feels physically connected, not random.

D) Make bottle the ONLY hero background visual
- Remove/disable other heavy hero backgrounds behind it.
- Keep only:
  - dark vignette gradient
  - subtle ocean-blue halo behind bottle
  - noise overlay
- Keep the existing navbar and hero content above it.

E) Integrate into Landing hero
- File: /frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx
- The hero section must be relative, full screen, and contain:
  - <BottleRollReveal /> as the background layer
  - Foreground hero content (title, subtitle, CTAs)
- Set z-index:
  - Bottle layer: z-10
  - Hero content: z-20
- Bottle layer pointer-events: none.

F) Responsiveness
- Desktop: bottle large, centered
- Mobile: bottle smaller and slightly lowered; reduce rotation and reveal intensity.

G) Accessibility / reduced motion
- If prefers-reduced-motion:
  - disable rolling + direction-based tilt
  - show the bottle fully revealed at ~0.6 opacity with minimal glow.

ANIMATION SPEC (SCROLL RANGE)
Use a hero ScrollTrigger:
- trigger: hero section
- start: "top top"
- end: "bottom top" (or "+=120%" if you want more room)
- scrub: true (smooth)

Timeline behavior across scroll progress 0 → 1:
1) Bottle reveal:
   - clipBottom: 100% → 0% (full reveal)
2) Rolling tilt:
   - rotateZ: 0deg → +6deg (but direction-sensitive adjustment onUpdate)
3) Depth:
   - scale: 0.98 → 1.06
   - y: 40px → -40px (gentle parallax)
4) Fade out near the end:
   - opacity: 1 → 0.25 at progress 0.9 → 1.0
   - so bottle doesn’t awkwardly persist beyond hero unless desired.

DELIVERABLE FILES
- Create/modify:
  - /frontend/src/components/BottleRollReveal.tsx (new)
  - /frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx (wire it in)
  - /frontend/src/lib/scroll.ts (helpers for Lenis + GSAP if you have)
  - /frontend/src/assets/aquaintel-bottle.webp (placeholder path)

ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST (MUST PASS)
- Bottle is the main hero background (clean scene, not cluttered).
- Scroll DOWN reveals bottle top→bottom smoothly.
- Scroll UP reveals bottle bottom→top smoothly (reverse).
- Bottle subtly “rolls” with direction (tilt + highlight shift), feels premium.
- No jitter, no layout shifts, no pointer blocking.
- Mobile looks clean; reduced motion works.

NOW IMPLEMENT:
Write the actual code in the specified files using GSAP + ScrollTrigger + Lenis + Tailwind, with clean comments and no TODOs for core behavior.
