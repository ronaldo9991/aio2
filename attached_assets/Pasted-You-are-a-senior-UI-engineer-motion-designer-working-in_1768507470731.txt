You are a senior UI engineer + motion designer working inside an existing React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind app (Replit). The landing hero already matches the screenshot (AQUAINTEL title, navbar, Explore/Login CTAs, dark ocean-blue glow background). Implement a premium “scroll bottle” background effect.

GOAL
Add a realistic PET plastic water bottle named “Aquaintel”, ~80% filled with water, as a background hero visual that animates smoothly on scroll up/down (Apple-style). The bottle must feel like it belongs behind the hero text, with subtle depth, glow, and parallax.

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- Use Lenis for smooth scroll (if already present, reuse it).
- Use GSAP + ScrollTrigger for scroll-driven animation.
- Keep it lightweight: one image (PNG/WebP) with optional subtle shader/blur glow via CSS; no heavy 3D.
- Ensure performance: transforms only (translate/rotate/scale), no layout thrashing.
- Respect layering: hero text and CTAs stay perfectly readable and clickable.
- The bottle should be visible in the hero and continue reacting as the user scrolls down/up, then gracefully fade/transition out when leaving the hero section.

ASSET REQUIREMENT (DO THIS FIRST)
1) Create a new asset placeholder at:
   /frontend/src/assets/aquaintel-bottle.webp (or .png)
2) If no real asset is available, generate a clean placeholder using CSS/SVG fallback temporarily, BUT structure the code so replacing with a real bottle image later is one-line.

VISUAL SPEC (MATCH THE SCREENSHOT VIBE)
- Bottle: transparent PET plastic with subtle highlights, mild condensation droplets, realistic cap.
- Water fill: 80% (clearly visible water line).
- Branding: minimal “Aquaintel” label or etched mark (clean, not loud).
- Color: neutral/clear plastic; water slightly tinted cool blue to match ocean accent.
- Lighting: soft ocean-blue rim light + subtle bloom/glow.
- Placement: behind the “AQUAINTEL” hero title, slightly offset to the right (or center-right), large enough to feel cinematic but not blocking text.
- Add a faint shadow/ambient occlusion so it sits in the scene.
- Add subtle “grain/noise overlay” across the entire hero (if not already).

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS
A) Add a BottleBackground component
- File: /frontend/src/components/BottleBackground.tsx
- It should render an absolutely-positioned container inside the hero section with:
  - bottle image layer
  - soft glow layer (blurred pseudo-element)
  - optional light streak / vignette mask
- Must use pointer-events:none so it never blocks clicks.

B) Integrate into Landing hero
- File: /frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx (or wherever hero lives)
- Wrap hero in a relative container.
- Insert <BottleBackground /> as a sibling behind hero content:
  - z-index: bottle (10), glow (5), hero text/buttons (20)
- Ensure it’s responsive:
  - Desktop: bottle prominent
  - Mobile: smaller, shifted lower, reduced opacity, reduce motion intensity

C) Scroll animation behavior (GSAP + ScrollTrigger)
Use ScrollTrigger tied to the hero section:
- On initial load: bottle is slightly lower + smaller + slightly blurred; then settles in (gentle intro)
- On scroll down through hero:
  - translateY: moves upward slowly (parallax)
  - rotateZ: tiny tilt (e.g., -2deg to +2deg)
  - scale: 1.0 -> 1.08 (very subtle)
  - opacity: 0.85 -> 0.35 toward hero end
  - blur/glow: glow reduces slightly as it fades out
- On scroll up: reverse smoothly (same timeline, scrubbed)
- When hero leaves viewport: bottle fades out completely so it doesn’t look “stuck” on other sections unless desired.

D) Premium micro-motions (subtle)
- Add tiny floating motion when user is idle (Framer Motion OR GSAP yoyo):
  - amplitude: 6–12px
  - duration: 4–6s
  - only when hero is in view
- Add a faint specular highlight shimmer (CSS gradient mask moving very slowly) optional.

E) Respect “browser frame” motif
If the landing is inside a BrowserFrame component, ensure the bottle stays inside that frame and doesn’t bleed outside.

F) Add safety + fallback
- If prefers-reduced-motion: disable scroll animation and keep a static bottle with reduced opacity.
- If asset missing: show a tasteful placeholder shape (gradient silhouette) rather than breaking.

DELIVERABLE
- Create/modify these files:
  - /frontend/src/components/BottleBackground.tsx (new)
  - /frontend/src/pages/Landing.tsx (wire it in)
  - /frontend/src/lib/scroll.ts (if you keep GSAP/Lenis helpers here)
  - /frontend/src/styles (optional) add bottle glow utilities if needed
- Ensure it compiles and runs in Replit.

ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST (MUST PASS)
- Bottle appears behind hero title exactly like a cinematic background element.
- Scroll down/up makes bottle move with smooth parallax (no jitter).
- Buttons remain clickable and text remains readable.
- Mobile looks clean (smaller bottle, less motion).
- Reduced-motion users get a static version.
- No console errors.

NOW DO IT:
Implement the component + GSAP ScrollTrigger animation with clean, production-quality code and comments.
